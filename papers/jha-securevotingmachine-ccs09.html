         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract"> 
We present an approach for the design and analysis of an electronicvoting machine based on a novel combination of formal
            verificationand systematic testing. The system was designed specificallyto enable verification and testing. In our architecture,
            the votingmachine is a finite-state transducer that implements the bare essentialsrequired for an election. We formally specify
            how eachcomponent of the machine is intended to work and formally verifythat a Verilog implementation of our design meets
            this specification.However, it is more challenging to verify that the compositionof these components will behave as a voter
            would expect, becauseformalizing human expectations is difficult. We show how systematictesting can be used to address this
            issue, and in particular toverify that the machine will behave correctly on election day.
