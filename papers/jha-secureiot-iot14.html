         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) composed of low-power, low-cost sensor nodes are expected to form the backbone of future intelligent networks for a broad range of civil, industrial and military applications. These sensor nodes are often deployed through random spreading, and function in dynamic environments. Many applications of WSNs such as pollution tracking, forest fire detection, and military surveillance require knowledge of the location of constituent nodes. But the use of technologies such as GPS on all nodes is prohibitive due to power and cost constraints. So, the sensor nodes need to autonomously determine their locations. Most localization techniques use anchor nodes with known locations to determine the position of remaining nodes. Localization techniques have two conflicting requirements. On one hand, an ideal localization technique should be computationally simple and on the other hand, it must be resistant to attacks that compromise anchor nodes. In this paper, we propose a computationally light-weight game theoretic secure localization technique and demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison to existing techniques.
