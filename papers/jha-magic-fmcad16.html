         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract"> In formal synthesis, the goal is to find a composition of components from a finite library such that the composition satisfies
            a given logical specification. In this paper, we consider the problem of synthesizing magic card tricks from component actions,
            where some of the actions depend on non-deterministic choices made by the audience. This problem can be naturally represented
            as a quantified logical formula of the form: Exists a composition, Forall nondeterministic choices, Uniquely-Exists intermediate
            and final outputs satisfying a logical specification, that is, an Exists-Forall-Exists satisfiability problem.  We present
            a novel approach to solve this problem that exploits the unique-existence of intermediate and final outputs for any given
            composition and choice values. We illustrate how several popular magic card tricks can be recovered using this approach. These
            tricks evolved through human ingenuity over decades, but we demonstrate that formal synthesis can generate a number of novel
            variants of these tricks within minutes. In contrast, a direct encoding to quantified SMT problem fails to find a solution
            in hours.
