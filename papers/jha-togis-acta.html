         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract"> Formal synthesis is the process of generating a program satisfying a high-level formal specification. In recent times, effective
            formal synthesis methods have been proposed based on  the use of inductive learning. We refer to this class of methods that
            learn programs from examples  as formal inductive synthesis. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for formal
            inductive synthesis. We discuss how formal inductive synthesis differs from traditional machine learning. We then describe
            oracle-guided inductive synthesis (OGIS), a framework that captures a family of synthesizers that operate by iteratively querying
            an oracle. An instance of OGIS that has had much practical impact is counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We
            present a theoretical characterization of CEGIS for learning any program that computes a recursive language. In particular,
            we analyze the relative power of CEGIS variants where the types of counterexamples generated by the oracle varies. We also
            consider the impact of bounded versus unbounded memory available to the learning algorithm. In the special case where the
            universe of candidate programs is finite, we relate the speed of convergence to the notion of teaching dimension studied in
            machine learning theory. Altogether, the results of the paper take a first step towards a theoretical foundation for the emerging
            field of formal inductive synthesis.
