         <h3>Abstract</h3>

         <p class="abstract">

In this paper, we consider the problem of learning Boolean
formulae from examples obtained by actively querying an oracle that
can label examples as positive or negative. This problem has received
attention in machine learning as well as formal methods, and it has been
shown to have exponential worst-case complexity in the general case as
well as for many restrictions. In this paper, we focus on learning sparse
Boolean formulae which depend on only a small (but unknown) subset of
the overall vocabulary of atomic propositions. We propose an efficient algorithm to learn these sparse Boolean formulae with a given confidence.
This assumption of sparsity is motivated by the problem of mining explanations for decisions made by artificially intelligent algorithms, where
the explanation of individual decisions may depend on a small but unknown subset of all the inputs to the algorithm. We demonstrate the use
of proposed learning algorithm to automatically generate explanations
of these decisions. These explanations will make intelligent systems more
understandable and accountable to human users, facilitate easier audits
and provide diagnostic information in the case of failure. The proposed
approach treats the AI algorithm as a black-box oracle, and is therefore, broadly applicable and agnostic to the specific AI algorithm. We
illustrate the practical effectiveness of our approach on a set of diverse
case-studies.
