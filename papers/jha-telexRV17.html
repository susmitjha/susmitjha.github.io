         <h3>Abstract</h3>

         <p class="abstract">

We propose a novel passive learning approach, TeLEx , to
infer signal temporal logic formulas that characterize the behavior of a
dynamical system using only observed signal traces of the system. The
approach requires two inputs: a set of observed traces and a template
Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formula. The unknown parameters in the
template can include time-bounds of the temporal operators, as well as
the thresholds in the inequality predicates. TeLEx finds the value of the
unknown parameters such that the synthesized STL property is satisfied
by all the provided traces and it is tight. This requirement of tightness is
essential to generating interesting properties when only positive examples
are provided and there is no option to actively query the dynamical
system to discover the boundaries of legal behavior. We propose a novel
quantitative semantics for satisfaction of STL properties which enables
TeLEx to learn tight STL properties without multidimensional optimization.
The proposed new metric is also smooth. This is critical to enable
use of gradient-based numerical optimization engines and it produces a
30X-100X speed-up with respect to the state-of-art gradient-free optimization.
The approach is implemented in a publicly available tool.
